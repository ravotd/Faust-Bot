## Contribution
Have a look into our issues. Some are explizitly marked as `help wanted` or `For Beginners`. If you're new to programming the last one would be a good point to begin with. Of course you're also free to choose your own issue or task to work on.
If you have any question you're also welcome to join us in `#faust-bot` on freenode.

Before creating a pull request please test your code. Untested, obviously buggy code will - of course - be rejected.
Since we're programming in python please hold on [PEP-08](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
